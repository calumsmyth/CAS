            <h3>Reacting to the challenge...</h3>
            <p>This very website is my first fully fleshed out project. I have also made a React app version which can be found here: <a href="https://cas-app-steel.vercel.app/" target="_blank">React version</a></p>
            <h3>Cooking up a storm!</h3>
            <p>I wanted to keep all of my favourite, healthy meal preperations, which are perfect for those gym gains, all in one place. So I decided to make a website to host them on called 'Gym Meal Preperations'. I will be looking to make a React version of this too. While still being worked on, you can find this bun in the oven here: <a href="https://calumsmyth.github.io/gmp/" target="'_blank">Gym Meal Preperations</a></p>
